1. Class and Object (example)
2. Class has data/attribute and funs/methods
    > code walkthrough
    > attribute get called itself, methods are called manually
3. why python is called OOP? Everything in python is an object(data structure, data type etc)
4. Advantage of OOPS:
    > you can create your own datatype
    > code reuseability
    > debugging
    > easy to colaboration
5. End to End project (Chatbook Class)
    > Function Vs methods
    > Magic methods or dunder methods
    > self
    > you cam create the attribute onside the class

    > Encapsulation
    > Getter and Setter
    > Static methods

5. Inheritance
    > Inheritance Code Example
    > Why Inheritance is needed?(code reuseability, parent has no access to child class)
    > What gets Inherited? - Constructor, Non private attribute, Non private methods
    > Constructor overloading & methods overloading
    > Super Keywords (Super Keywords only used in child class),(Cannot access varibale or attribute ) used only inside child class
